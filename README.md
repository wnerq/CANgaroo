## ⚙️ Features

*   **Real-time CAN/CAN-FD/LIN Decoding**: Support for standard CAN, high-speed CAN-FD, and LIN bus frames.
*   **Wide Hardware Compatibility**: Works with **SocketCAN** (Linux), **PEAK PCAN**, **Kvaser**, **Vector**, **TinyCAN**, **CANable**, **Candlelight**, **SLCAN**, **CANblaster** (UDP) and **Zilogic USB to CAN FD Adaptor**.
*   **DBC & LDF Database Support**: Load multiple `.dbc` files for CAN signal decoding and `.ldf` files for LIN bus signal decoding.
*   **Powerful Data Visualization**: Integrated Graphing tools supporting Time-series, Scatter charts, Text-based monitoring, and interactive Gauge views with zoom and live tooltips. Supports both CAN and LIN signals.
*   **Advanced Filtering & Logging**: Isolate critical data with live filters and export captures for offline analysis.
*   **Network Rights Management**: Per-network access control for bus interfaces.
*   **Python Scripting**: Built-in script editor with an embedded Python interpreter (via pybind11). Send and receive CAN and LIN messages, decode signals using loaded DBC/LDF files, and automate tasks. Scripts can be started manually or automatically with the measurement. Ready-to-use example scripts are included in the `examples/` directory.
*   **CAN Gateway**: Forward messages between two CAN interfaces with configurable per-message filter rules. Active during a running measurement.
*   **LIN Control**: Send LIN Sleep/Wakeup commands, switch schedule tables, and issue LIN diagnostic requests and responses (slave node) on LIN-capable interfaces directly from the UI.
*   **Trace Replay**: Replay captured CAN logs (Vector ASC, candump, PCAP, and PCAPng formats) with adjustable speed, per-message RX/TX direction filtering, channel mapping to live interfaces, and optional autoplay with the measurement. Supports classic CAN, CAN-FD, RTR, and error frames.
*   **Multiple Export Formats**: Save traces as Vector ASC, Vector MDF4, Linux candump, PCAP, or PCAPng (Wireshark-compatible).
*   **Modern Workspace**: A clean, dockable userinterface optimized for multi-monitor setups.

## 🛠️ Building
### 🐧 Linux

#### Install dependencies

| Distribution | Command |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Ubuntu / Debian** | `sudo apt install build-essential qt6-base-dev qt6-charts-dev qt6-serialport-dev qt6-serialbus-dev qt6-svg-dev qt6-tools-dev qt6-l10n-tools libqt6opengl6-dev libnl-3-dev libnl-route-3-dev python3-dev pybind11-dev pkg-config` |
| **Fedora** | `sudo dnf install gcc-c++ make qt6-qtbase-devel qt6-qtcharts-devel qt6-qtserialport-devel qt6-qtserialbus-devel qt6-qtsvg-devel qt6-qttools-devel libnl3-devel python3-devel pybind11-devel pkgconfig` |
| **Arch Linux** | `sudo pacman -S base-devel qt6-base qt6-charts qt6-serialport qt6-serialbus qt6-svg qt6-tools libnl python pybind11 pkgconf` |

#### Build:

```bash
qmake6
make -j$(nproc)
```
The binary will be in `bin/cangaroo`.

#### SocketCAN privileges

CANgaroo uses `ip link` to configure SocketCAN interfaces (bitrate, sample point, CAN FD), which requires `CAP_NET_ADMIN`. The recommended way is a targeted sudoers rule so no password prompt appears:

```bash
sudo groupadd cangaroo
sudo usermod -aG cangaroo $USER
```

Create `/etc/sudoers.d/cangaroo`:
```
%cangaroo ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /sbin/ip link set * down, /sbin/ip link set * up type can *
```

Log out and back in for the group membership to take effect. If you prefer not to use a group, you can instead grant `CAP_NET_ADMIN` directly to the `ip` binary (applies to all users):
```bash
sudo setcap cap_net_admin+ep /sbin/ip
```

> **Note:** If the interface is set to *"Configured by OS"* in the setup dialog, CANgaroo will not touch the interface configuration and no elevated privileges are needed.

### 🪟 Windows

* Install [Qt 6](https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer) (Community / Open Source) including the **Qt Serial Bus** component.
* Install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11) (`pip install pybind11`).
* Open `cangaroo.pro` in Qt Creator and build.

For instructions on building Qt from source with MSYS2/MinGW and compiling
CANgaroo natively on Windows, see [Building on Windows](docs/BuildingOnWindows.md).

#### Deployment

Include the required Qt6 libraries or run `windeployqt` on the `.exe`:
```
windeployqt --release cangaroo.exe
```

### Optional hardware drivers

**PEAK PCAN** (`CONFIG+=peakcan`) — Windows only:
  1. Download [PCAN-Basic SDK](https://www.peak-system.com/fileadmin/media/files/PCAN-Basic.zip) and extract to `src/driver/PeakCanDriver/pcan-basic-api/`.
  2. Build with `qmake CONFIG+=peakcan` (or add `peakcan` to the Qt Creator qmake arguments).
  3. Place `PCANBasic.dll` (from `pcan-basic-api/x64/`) next to the built `.exe`.

**Kvaser** (`CONFIG+=kvaser`) — Linux and Windows:

  *Linux:*
  1. Download and build [linuxcan](https://www.kvaser.com/downloads-kvaser/) (V5.51.461 or newer):
     ```bash
     tar -xf linuxcan.tar.gz
     make -C linuxcan/canlib
     sudo make -C linuxcan/canlib install
     sudo ldconfig
     ```
  2. Build with `qmake6 CONFIG+=kvaser`.

  *Windows:*
  1. Install the [Kvaser CANlib SDK](https://www.kvaser.com/downloads-kvaser/) (V5.51.461 or newer).
  2. Build with `qmake CONFIG+=kvaser CANLIB_DIR="C:/path/to/Kvaser/Canlib"`.
  3. Place `canlib32.dll` (from `Canlib/Bin/`) next to the built `.exe`.

**Vector** (always enabled) — Windows only:
  * Install the [Vector XL Driver Library](https://www.vector.com/int/en/products/products-a-z/libraries-drivers/xl-driver-library/) on the target machine.
  * No build-time SDK needed — Qt's `serialbus` module handles the integration.

**TinyCAN** (toggle in Measurement > Driver menu) — Linux and Windows:
  * Install the [TinyCAN](https://www.mhs-elektronik.de/) driver/library on the target machine.
  * No build-time SDK needed — Qt's `serialbus` module handles the integration.
  * Enable the driver via **Measurement > Driver > TinyCAN** and restart the application.

**Zilogic USB to CAN FD Adaptor** (`CONFIG+=zscanfd`) — Windows:
  1. Download the [zscanfd.dll device driver](The download link has been added to the `src.pro` file) on the target machine.
  2. Download the [qtzscanfdbus.dll Qt plugin](The download link has been added to the `src.pro` file) on the target machine.
  3. Build with `qmake CONFIG+=zscanfd` (or add `zscanfd` to the Qt Creator qmake arguments).
  4. Place the `qtzscanfdbus.dll` from `plugin/canbus`
  5. Place the `zscanfd.dll` from `bin/cangaroo`

## ARXML to DBC Conversion

Cangaroo natively supports DBC. If you have ARXML files, you can convert them using `canconvert`:
```bash
# Install canconvert
pip install canconvert

# Convert ARXML to DBC
canconvert TCU.arxml TCU.dbc
```
